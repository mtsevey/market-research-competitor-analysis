# Market Research & Competitor Analysis of U.S. Video Streaming Services (2025)

## Introduction

The rapid growth of video‑streaming platforms has reshaped media consumption. To illustrate how market research and competitive benchmarking can inform strategic decisions, this case study analyses the U.S. streaming service market using publicly available data for 2025. The project benchmarks competitors, calculates market share, and synthesises qualitative insights through SWOT and PESTLE frameworks.

## Data Source and Methodology

A dataset of U.S. streaming platforms was compiled from Statista data reported in a 2025 market share study by Evoca【472247096925510†L76-L105】. The dataset lists the major streaming platforms and their market share percentages:

| Platform | Market Share (%) |
|---------|------------------|
| Amazon Prime Video | 22 |
| Netflix | 21 |
| Max | 13 |
| Disney+ | 12 |
| Hulu | 11 |
| Paramount+ | 9 |
| Apple TV+ | 7 |
| Peacock | 1 |
| Other | 4 |

The quantitative analysis ranks platforms by market share and measures the gap between each competitor and the market leader. Visualisations include bar and pie charts to show market distribution. A SWOT analysis for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ summarises internal strengths and weaknesses alongside external opportunities and threats【628137180640470†L124-L134】【943408289325718†L178-L207】【775906557458188†L65-L72】. A PESTLE analysis highlights macro‑environmental forces affecting streaming services【695573808259092†L51-L74】【695573808259092†L76-L89】.

## Findings

### Market Share and Competitive Positioning

- **Amazon Prime Video and Netflix dominate** – with 22 % and 21 % of the U.S. streaming market respectively, the top two services capture nearly half of subscribers【472247096925510†L76-L105】.
- **Mid‑tier competitors** – Max (13 %), Disney+ (12 %) and Hulu (11 %) form a second tier. They maintain strong audiences but must differentiate to challenge the leaders.
- **Niche players** – Paramount+ (9 %), Apple TV+ (7 %), Peacock (1 %) and the aggregated “Other” category (4 %) hold relatively small shares, indicating fragmented demand.

### SWOT Highlights

| Service | Strengths | Weaknesses | Opportunities | Threats |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Netflix** | Strong global brand, large subscriber base, highly valued original content and adaptable service【628137180640470†L124-L134】 | Rising debt, concentration on few hits, increasing prices and dependence on North America【628137180640470†L137-L144】 | Ad‑supported plans, low‑priced mobile tiers, international expansion, refreshed licensed content【628137180640470†L148-L153】 | Intense competition, regulatory restrictions, piracy, password sharing and market saturation【628137180640470†L155-L160】 |
| **Amazon Prime Video** | Global reach with 175 M users; accessible across devices; bundled benefits; rich content library; adaptive streaming and smart search【943408289325718†L178-L207】 | Limited original content, confusing interface, UI issues and mixed paid/free content; smaller user base than Netflix【943408289325718†L209-L226】 | Media acquisitions, price reductions, educational content, 5G streaming, subscriber growth and device partnerships【943408289325718†L229-L257】 | Growing competition, legal hurdles, piracy, viewer addiction and competitor price cuts【943408289325718†L262-L282】 |
| **Disney+** | High‑quality adaptive playback, user‑friendly interface, strong content brands (Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars), unique original content and broad accessibility【775906557458188†L65-L72】 | Niche family‑oriented catalogue and perceptions of being expensive or overly commercial【775906557458188†L73-L76】 | Acquisitions, price adjustments and expanded content for children and niche audiences【775906557458188†L77-L80】 | Fierce competition, parental concerns about screen time and complexity of managing Disney’s vast content portfolio【775906557458188†L81-L83】 |

### PESTLE Insights

- **Political and legal factors** – Geopolitical tensions and censorship can restrict market access, while national content‑promotion policies offer opportunities【695573808259092†L51-L74】. Compliance with varied regulations is essential.
- **Economic factors** – Rising purchasing power fuels demand for streaming, but high inflation may spur cancellations; pricing strategies must account for cost sensitivity【695573808259092†L76-L89】.
- **Sociocultural factors** – Growing interest in multicultural content and regional preferences create opportunities for localisation, yet free media clips on social platforms threaten subscription growth【695573808259092†L101-L119】.
- **Technological factors** – Widespread mobile device usage and improving internet connectivity enable streaming expansion【695573808259092†L132-L137】.

## Recommendations

1. **Differentiate through content and pricing** – Mid‑tier players such as Max and Disney+ should invest in exclusive content and consider competitive pricing strategies to close the gap with Amazon Prime Video and Netflix.
2. **Leverage partnerships and bundles** – Bundling streaming with other services (e.g., telecom plans or gaming subscriptions) and securing telecom partnerships can expand reach and create stickier offerings.
3. **Localise content** – Platforms should tailor content for regional tastes and languages to capitalise on rising multicultural interest and regionalism【695573808259092†L101-L118】.
4. **Ad‑supported and mobile tiers** – Netflix’s exploration of ad‑supported and mobile‑only plans demonstrates a path to attract price‑sensitive consumers and compete in markets with variable purchasing power【628137180640470†L148-L153】.
5. **Address UI and experience issues** – Prime Video should streamline its interface and improve search and playback reliability to enhance user satisfaction【943408289325718†L209-L226】.
6. **Mitigate threats** – Companies must invest in anti‑piracy measures, adhere to regional regulations and monitor competitive pricing and market saturation to avoid subscriber churn【628137180640470†L155-L160】.

## Conclusion

Market research and competitor analysis provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the streaming industry. By analysing market share data and applying SWOT and PESTLE frameworks, we identified leadership positions, strategic opportunities and potential risks for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+. These findings inform actionable recommendations for differentiation, partnerships, localisation and customer experience improvements. The techniques demonstrated here—data compilation, quantitative analysis and strategic frameworks—can be applied to other markets to inform consulting, business analysis or product management decisions.
