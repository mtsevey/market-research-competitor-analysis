    "# Market Research & Competitor Analysis: U.S. Streaming Services\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a market research and competitor analysis of the U.S. video streaming service market. The dataset is compiled from Statista data via Evoca (2025) and reports the market share of major streaming platforms in the United States【472247096925510†L76-L105】. The objective is to benchmark competitors by market share, calculate rankings, and visualise the market structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset `us_streaming_market_share.csv` contains two columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform** – name of the streaming service.\n",
    "- **MarketShare** – percentage of U.S. market share for 2025 (as reported by Statista via Evoca【472247096925510†L76-L105】).\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Platform | Market Share (%) |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|\n",
    "| Amazon Prime Video | 22 |\n",
    "| Netflix | 21 |\n",
    "| Max | 13 |\n",
    "| Disney+ | 12 |\n",
    "| Hulu | 11 |\n",
    "| Paramount+ | 9 |\n",
    "| Apple TV+ | 7 |\n",
    "| Peacock | 1 |\n",
    "| Other | 4 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Steps\n",
    "1. Load the dataset with pandas.\n",
    "2. Rank platforms by market share.\n",
    "3. Calculate each platform's difference from the top competitor.\n",
    "4. Visualise the market share distribution using bar and pie charts.\n",
    "5. Summarise insights and recommendations.\n"

    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that Amazon Prime Video and Netflix dominate the U.S. streaming market with 22% and 21% market share respectively, followed by Max (13%), Disney+ (12%), and Hulu (11%)【472247096925510†L76-L105】. Paramount+ and Apple TV+ are mid‑tier competitors with single-digit shares, while Peacock and the combined 'Other' category represent niche players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observations:**\n",
    "- **Top competitors:** Amazon Prime Video narrowly leads Netflix by one percentage point, indicating intense competition at the top.\n",
    "- **Mid‑tier differentiation:** Max and Disney+ hold substantial market share but lag behind the leaders. Targeted content strategies and partnerships could help them close the gap.\n",
    "- **Niche services:** Peacock and the 'Other' category account for minimal share, suggesting that consolidation or differentiation may be necessary to remain competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide a baseline for deeper strategic analysis, including SWOT and PESTLE assessments of leading services.\n"
